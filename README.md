# AutoAssets
Manage and generate your own developer resources in code

**AutoAssets** is a tool to streamline the generation and integration of common resources

- Create xcode assets with platform specific metadata
- Create color sets from colors, including `SwiftUI.Color`
- Convert `SwiftUI.View` and colors into images or icons
- Replace existing assets with the `write(to:name:)` function

> [!NOTE]
> **Please read and run tests to get started**
